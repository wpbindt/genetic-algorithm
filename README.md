# Genetic algorithms
This repo contains an application of genetic algorithms to the knapsack problem and maximizing continuous functions from **R** to **R**. For example usage, see `knapsack_example.py` and `continuous_example.py`. Aside from the tests, this only depends on the standard library. For more info, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm).

## Tests and mypy
For a quick and easy dopamine fix, run `make test` or `make mypy` in the root directory. This assumes you have Docker installed.
